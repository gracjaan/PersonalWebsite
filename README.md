## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The website's frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js allows for efficient component-based development and ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Three.js**: Three.js is used for creating and rendering 3D graphics in the browser. It adds a visually engaging aspect to the website, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling and responsive design. It streamlines the development process with a utility-first approach and ensures the website looks great on various screen sizes.
